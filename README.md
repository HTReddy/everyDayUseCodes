# everyDayUseCodes
This repository consists of programs that are useful for everyday use such as reading, writing files etc.
My name is Hari and I hope this repository helps folks looking for solutions to simple yet cumbersome problems we encounter everyday to perform our tasks. One such example is renaming a list of file names (about 1000 let us say), renaming each and every file for 1000 times is definitely a clumsy task, instead I have a program that renames any number of files in a folder in just a matter of seconds.
